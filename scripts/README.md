# Geometry Trinity

Geometry Trinity android game source code (very bad project structure and digusting code)

Second that big project I made.
Graphics were made by my brother.

Link to the Google Play Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pip.circlerisk
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pip.geometrytrinity

At this point, I would design, write everything completely different and use the latest ES.

How do I rate my code? - DISGUSTING !
